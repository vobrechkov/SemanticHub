# Chat API Configuration - Example/Template
#
# Copy this file to .env.local and modify as needed for your development environment
#
# When running via .NET Aspire AppHost:
#   - NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_API_URL is automatically set via service discovery
#   - You don't need to set anything manually
#   - Check the Aspire dashboard to see the actual service URLs
#
# For standalone development (npm run dev without Aspire):
#   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL to your local Agent API endpoint
#   - Default is http://localhost:5000
#
# Priority order:
#   1. NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAT_API_URL (Aspire service discovery - highest priority)
#   2. NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL (local override below)
#   3. http://localhost:5000 (hardcoded fallback)

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
